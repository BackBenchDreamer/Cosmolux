## 🌌 Features
Real-Time 3D Orrery: Visualize the positions and orbits of NEOs using WebGL technology powered by Three.js.

Dynamic Information Panels: Access detailed data on each object, including size, velocity, and proximity to Earth.

Interactive Timeline Controls: Observe the motion of NEOs over time, enhancing understanding of their trajectories.

## 🚀 Purpose
Cosmolux addresses the challenge of making complex astronomical data accessible and engaging. By integrating NASA's Near-Earth Object API, it transforms raw data into an intuitive visual interface, aiding in education and awareness about space hazards and planetary defense.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Three.js: For rendering interactive 3D graphics in the browser.

R: Utilized for data processing and integration with NASA's APIs.

NASA NEO API: Provides real-time data on Near-Earth Objects.
